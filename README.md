Amanda & Kem's Jeopardy
-------------------


**Description**

A Jeopardy! inspired Angular Web App, redesigned for my buddy and his wife.

**How it works**

Using Angular's angularModalService, it allocates information from the $scope.round object of the categories, dollar amounts, questions and answers to the appropiarte position.

Users can click on the dollar amount and a modal pops up that allows players to regiester their response. As the game continues, the score is update in real time.

When the questions have all been answered, final jeopary button appears
